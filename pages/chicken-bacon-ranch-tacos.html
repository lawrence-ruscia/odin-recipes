    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices bacon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>6 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped red onion</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
      <li>2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning 
        <br>occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on 
        <br>paper towels.</li>
      <li>Whisk smoked paprika, onion powder, oregano, and garlic salt together in a 
        <br>shallow bowl. Coat chicken with seasoning, and cook on the prepared grill until 
        <br>no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An 
        <br>instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 
        <br>degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place tortillas on the hot grill and heat until lightly grilled, 20 to 30 seconds per 
        <br>side.</li>
      <li>Slice chicken and place in warm tortillas. Top with shredded lettuce, red onions,
        <br>shredded cheese, and chopped tomatoes. Drizzle with ranch dressing. Crumble 
        <br>bacon over top. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
