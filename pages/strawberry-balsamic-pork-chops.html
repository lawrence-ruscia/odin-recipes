    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These strawberry balsamic pork chops in a sweetly tart glaze are a one-skillet 
      <br>dish that takes full advantage of how well fruit and pork go together, and the
      <br>delicious combination of strawberries and balsamic vinegar. You can adjust the
      <br>sweetness by using as much or as little honey as you like. Serve with a crusty,</br>
      buttery bread and a simple tossed salad.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
