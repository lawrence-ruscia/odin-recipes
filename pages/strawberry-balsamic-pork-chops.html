    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These strawberry balsamic pork chops in a sweetly tart glaze are a
      one-skillet
      <br />dish that takes full advantage of how well fruit and pork go
      together, and the <br />delicious combination of strawberries and balsamic
      vinegar. You can adjust the <br />sweetness by using as much or as little
      honey as you like. Serve with a crusty,<br />
      buttery bread and a simple tossed salad.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>3 cups sliced fresh strawberries</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>several fresh thyme sprigs, plus extra for garnish</li>
      <li>4 (3/4-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet over
        medium heat. <br />
        Stir in balsamic vinegar and cook until mixture is bubbly and fragrant,
        about 1 <br />
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sliced strawberries, honey, a pinch of salt, and fresh thyme
        sprigs,to taste <br />
        to the skillet. Stir, and cook until strawberries are softened and the
        liquid has <br />
        thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour into a
        small bowl, <br />
        remove thyme sprigs, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe out the skillet, return to the burner, add the remaining butter,
        and pour in <br />
        olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat chops dry; season to taste with salt and pepper. When butter stops
        bubbling, <br />
        add seasoned chops and cook until browned on each side, 1 to 3 minutes.
        Add <br />
        strawberry mixture to the skillet, and turn each chop to coat with the
        liquid. <br />
        Stack strawberries on top of each chop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer until an instant read thermometer inserted near the center of
        chops reads <br />
        145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 6 to 10 minutes. Garnish with additional
        fresh thyme <br />
        sprigs, if desired, and serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
